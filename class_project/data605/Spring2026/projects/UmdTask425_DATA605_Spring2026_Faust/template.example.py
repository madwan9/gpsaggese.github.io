# # Template Example Notebook
#
# This is a template notebook. The first heading should be the title of what notebook is about. For example, if it is a project on neo4j tutorial the heading should be `Project Title`.
#
# - Add description of what the notebook does.
# - Point to references, e.g. (neo4j.example.md)
# - Add citations.
# - Keep the notebook flow clear.
# - Comments should be imperative and have a period at the end.
# - Your code should be well commented.
#
# The name of this notebook should in the following format:
# - if the notebook is exploring `pycaret API`, then it is `pycaret.example.ipynb`
#
# Follow the reference to write notebooks in a clear manner: https://github.com/causify-ai/helpers/blob/master/docs/coding/all.jupyter_notebook.how_to_guide.md

# ## Make the notebook flow clear
# Each notebook needs to follow a clear and logical flow, e.g:
# - Load data
# - Compute stats
# - Clean data
# - Compute stats
# - Do analysis
# - Show results
